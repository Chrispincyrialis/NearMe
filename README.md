## NearMe

**NearMe** is a mobile app built to make money sharing and proximity-based interactions effortless. It enables fast, mistake-free transfers between individuals and between people and nearby businesses using NFC, removing the need for USSD menus, STK prompts, or manually entering phone numbers and payment details.

Traditional mobile payments rely heavily on user input, which introduces friction and human error—sending money to the wrong person, mistyping numbers, or approving unclear prompts. NearMe replaces that flow with proximity and intent. If you’re near someone or a shop, you tap. The rest is handled securely.

### Context-aware payments

NFC in NearMe is more than just “tap to pay.” Each tap is aware of its environment:

* the user’s location
* the device or terminal being tapped
* the type of interaction taking place

This allows a single tap to bundle multiple actions together, such as:

* payment
* check-in
* receipt generation
* loyalty or reward attribution
* ticket validation or access control

Instead of multiple steps and apps, NearMe turns proximity into a single, meaningful interaction.

### Reduced social engineering & human error

By removing manual data entry and ambiguous prompts, NearMe significantly reduces social engineering risks. Users only approve transactions they physically initiate, with nearby, known devices. Losing a phone is often safer than losing a SIM or eSIM, thanks to biometric authentication, secure hardware, and tokenized credentials.

### Programmable payments

Unlike cash, NearMe payments are programmable. Developers and users can:

* set spending limits
* auto-approve low-value transactions
* restrict merchant or interaction types
* bind payments to identity, time, or location
* trigger events after successful transactions

This makes payments smarter, safer, and more adaptable to real-world use cases.

### Vision

NearMe is not just a payment app. It’s a proximity layer for sharing value, data, and access—starting with money, and expanding to files, identity, and real-world interactions. One tap. Clear intent. No wasted time
